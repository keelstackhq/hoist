# hoist

Provision and verify a repo's GitHub and Cloudflare setup from what the repo already says
(workflows, `wrangler.jsonc`, `package.json`, `renovate.json`, optional `hoist.toml`). A single
static Rust binary. Part of the keelstackhq family (hull, splice, hoard).

Status: M2 in progress. `apply` writes (after a preflight and a confirmation); every other command
only sends GET requests. Release comes in a later milestone.
Design: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-16-hoist-design.md`.

## Install

From source (Rust 1.97, see `rust-toolchain.toml`):

```bash
cargo install --path .
```

## Commands

```bash
hoist explain                 # desired model and the file each item came from
hoist plan [--area github|cloudflare]    # diff desired vs live, no writes
hoist check [--area ...]      # plan plus verification (required checks, Pages URL)
hoist apply [--yes] [--prune] [--area ...]  # write the plan, then verify like check
hoist auth check              # what each token can read vs what hoist needs
```

Global flags: `-C <dir>` (repo to inspect), `--json`, `--no-color`, `-v`. `--json` prints exactly
one object on stdout; logs go to stderr. Actions are `create`, `update`, `ok`, `drift`,
`pending`, `unknown` (`unknown` means hoist could not read the resource, for example a 403).
A rejected token (401) or a repo the token cannot see (404) is an error (exit 3), not `unknown`.

Secrets are checked for presence only: a workflow secret counts as present when it is a
repository secret or an organization secret the repo can use. Environment secrets are not
checked in M1. The merge queue is expected on when a workflow has a `merge_group` trigger
(override with `[github] merge_queue`).

| `GH_TOKEN`              | used when `GITHUB_TOKEN` is unset; then `gh auth token`                             |

| `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` | Cloudflare account id (or set it in `hoist.toml`); not needed for `--area github`   |
| `HOIST_GITHUB_API`      | GitHub API base, default `https://api.github.com`                                   |
